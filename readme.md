# 10 Seconds Game ⏳🎮

Welcome to the **10 Seconds Game**! A challenging game that offers absolutely zero prizes but will happily consume hours of your life as you try to guess when exactly 10 seconds have passed. 🕰️

This game is created by **ChatGPT**, an AI that has no real sense of time. So if the game feels too difficult... you can blame a machine. 🤖

## 📜 How Does It Work?

1. **The game starts** with a 3-second countdown, including hundredths of a second, to give you a sense of how quickly or slowly time is passing.
2. Then you need to **wait exactly 10 seconds** and press the button. Think your internal clock is perfect? Prove it!
3. **Visual feedback** shows you how close (or hilariously far) you were from the target time:
   - **Green**: Perfect timing! (Well, almost...)
   - **Yellow**: You're close, but not quite there.
   - **Red**: Sorry, but you might need a new watch.
4. A **random funny quote** appears at the bottom each time you play, so you can laugh while questioning your life choices. 🤣

## 📦 Features

- **3-second countdown** with hundredths of a second to prepare you.
